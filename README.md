This repository contains a simple, interactive Python script for playing the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game is straightforward to play and demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditional statements.

How to Play
Once you run the script, the game will prompt you to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering the corresponding number:

0 — Rock
1 — Paper
2 — Scissors
The computer will randomly select its choice, and the game will display the result of the match. You can continue playing as many rounds as you like until you choose to exit.
